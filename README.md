# Beat Master

Beat Master is an interactive rhythm game built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The game presents a sequence of musical beats on a track, which the player must hit at the correct time to earn points.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beatmaster.git
cd beatmaster
```bash

Open the index.html file in your browser to start the game.

## Gameplay
The game uses Brazilian Samba "surdo" drum beats as the backdrop. The player needs to click on the drumming area at the right time when a beat crosses the line to score points. The beats accelerate over time, increasing the challenge.

## Future Plans
Beat Master is in active development and we plan to add the following features:

1. New Instruments: We aim to incorporate different drum beats such as snares, bass drums, and cymbals to enrich the game's musical texture.

2. User Profiles: To allow players to track their progress and high scores, we plan to implement user profiles.

3. Difficulty Levels: We intend to add difficulty levels, making the game suitable for a wider range of players, from beginners to seasoned musicians.

4. Multiplayer Mode: We're exploring the possibility of a multiplayer mode, where players can compete in real-time.

5. Backtracks: We're planning to add backing tracks to provide a more immersive rhythmic experience.

6. Custom Beat Patterns: A feature to create and share your own beat patterns is on the roadmap.
